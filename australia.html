<h1>1. Blue Mountains</h1>
<img src="autraimage/blue.jpg" class="polar" alt="image"/>
<div class="post-s">
<p><a>If you’re looking for a dose of nature, the Blue Mountains are for you. Only 1.5 hours from the hustle and bustle of Sydney, it can be visited as a day trip or a weekend getaway, depending on your travel time frame. Make sure you have time to visit Wentworth Falls. This spot offers walks of varying difficulty with stunning views of the waterfall.</a></p>

<h1>2. Bathurst</h1>
<img src="autraimage/Bathurst.jpg" class="polar" alt="image"/>
<div class="post-s">
<p><a>Bathurst is one of my favourite spots in Australia for so many reasons. One of them is that my cousins have farms out there. They let me stay whenever I pass through and bring me to cattle markets, which is a real novelty to me having grown up in the city. The other reason I love Bathurst is because it is often overlooked by tourists, despite having so much to offer. </a></p>

<div class="container1">
<div class="post">
<h1>3. Sydney</h1>
<img src="autraimage/Sydney.jpg" class="polar" alt="image"/>
<div class="post-s">
<p><a>Sydney is the largest city in Australia – filled with beautiful beaches, fun activities and good food. One of the best ways to view the beauty of Sydney is by taking a relaxing stroll. An amazing beach walk, and one of the best, is from Bondi Beach to Coogee Beach. It offers gorgeous views of the area’s famous rocky beaches, thin beaches and sandy beaches.</a></p>

<h1>4.Byron Bay</h1>
<img src="autraimage/byron.jpg" class="polar" alt="image"/>
<div class="post-s">
<p><a>Byron is one of Australia’s top tourist destinations but if you’re willing to put in a little work you can still find some more well hidden gems just out the back in the hinterland mountains. From countless waterfalls and swimming holes to incredible mountains and bush walks this small region hide so much beauty.</a></p>

<div class="container1">
<div class="post">
<h1>5. Melbourne</h1>
<img src="autraimage/Melbourne.jpg" class="polar" alt="image"/>
<div class="post-s">
<p><a>Melbourne has secured its spot of the most liveable city in the world the seventh time in a row. Most days see a varied weather – hail, sunshine, rain, wind – but that doesn’t impede the livelihood of Melbourne. Any given day you can find an event, an exhibit, a music gig, or a show to relish.</a></h2>

<h2 id="cost">Typical cost</h2>
<p><strong>Accomendation</strong>-In northern Queensland, you can find hostel prices for about $20 AUD per night. On the west coast, it’s about $15-20 AUD, but from Noosa down to Melbourne (the densely populated east coast), expect to pay $25–35 AUD per night. The smaller the dorm, the higher the cost. Private rooms are $55–110 AUD per night.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation</strong>-But outside of the heavily populated and highly competitive east coast, it’s not always that easy. Because of limited competition, flying is very expensive except on the west coast. It’s often cheaper to fly than get a bus out there. If you can get a deal on a tourist bus, that can be cheaper than either Greyhound or flying. On the east coast, Greyhound offers many good-value passes. I’d take them over any other transportation. The Cairns to Melbourne pass is $558 AUD.e</p>
<p><strong>Food</strong>-Your average meal in Australia will run you about $15–20 AUD. A good meal at a nice restaurant will run you about $40 AUD. Even McDonald’s is expensive—a value meal is about $8 AUD.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Travelling Tips</h2>
<ol>
<li>The Distance – The classic error first-time visitors make is trying to 'do' Australia in two or three weeks, forgetting that it's a continent as well as a country. It's far better to pick two or three areas to tackle well than attempt to tick off the highlights in one visit. Otherwise, most of the visit is spent in transit.</li>
<li>The Seaons- Another common misconception is that because Australia is in the southern hemisphere, the seasons are reversed from the northern hemisphere. That's true in the south of the country, but definitely not in the north. The best time to visit Sydney may be November to April, but visitors don't realise it's the opposite for the Great Barrier Reef and the Top End – when that's the monumentally soggy and sweaty wet season</li>
<li>The size of Kangaroos-The eastern grey kangaroos are bigger, leaner and tougher-looking than most visitors imagine. And the red kangaroos are all that doubled. They're still incredibly cute, though. Just don't stand near one when it's about to kick.</li>
<li>Lower ranking natural areas -Australia designates pretty much every patch of greenery as a National Park. It's tempting to write this off as overzealousness. But then you go to them, and they're absolutely gorgeous. Put the likes of The Grampians or Oxley Wild Rivers National Park in the Eastern US or Western Europe, and everyone would be raving about them.</li>
<li>Educational sign-posting - Even the spots that don't have a massive wow factor tend to be pepped up with a blizzard of educational signs explaining what the trees are, how the ecosystem works and what creatures can be found living there. Australia has a knack for turning moderately pleasant walks (Manly to Wynnum in Brisbane is a classic case in point) into something a little bit more interesting.</li>
<li>Plus Sockets -They're not the British ones, as might be expect for historical reasons. But neither are they the American or European ones. Australia gets its own plug sockets, which are basically the American ones, but drunkenly slouching inwards. </li>
