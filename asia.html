Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres (17,212,000 sq mi), about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population,[5] was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely

<span font-weight="400">constitute roughly 60% of the world's population</span>

<h1>1. Siem Reap, Cambodia</h1>
<img src="imageasia/combodia.jpg" class="polar" alt="image"/>
<div class="post-s">
<p><a>Siem Reap has been called the “perfect destination” for first time travelers to Asia. This capital city in northwestern Cambodia is easy to get around, and you’ll find attractions on nearly every corner, with friendly people, lots of history, culture, nightlife, museums, markets and opportunities for relaxing as well as taking part in adventurous activities. </a></p>

<h1>2. Hanoi, Vietnam</h1>
<img src="imageasia/hanoi.jpg" class="polar" alt="image"/>
<div class="post-s">
<p><a>The charming Vietnamese capital is different than other Asian capitals as a graceful collage of cultural influences from the French and Chinese, yet still retaining local Vietnamese ways. It’s aged well, with the well-preserved Old Quarter, a maze of streets more than 1,000 years old set between the city’s famed Hoan Kiem Lake, the Red River and the few walls that remain of the Hanoi Citadel .</a></p>

<div class="post-s">
<p><a>In Tokyo, traditional collides with pop culture, offering everything from belting out a song at a karaoke bar to reverently wandering through ancient temples. While it’s chaotic, crowded and expensive, everything is incredibly clean and the people are extremely polite. </a></p>

<h1>4. Singapore, Singapore</h1>
<img src="imageasia/sg.jpg" class="polar" alt="image"/>
<div class="post-s">
<p><a>Singapore, with a cityscape that looks as if it was ripped right out of the pages of a sci-fi book, has become an economic powerhouse over the past half century, with a high standard of living and numerous reasons to visit. It’s considered a shopper’s paradise with its numerous malls, though it also offers magnificent architecture, culture and amazing public art along with a slice of horticultural heaven.</a></p>

<h1>5. Hong Kong, China</h1>

<div class="post-s">
<p><a>Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, is one of the world’s leading financial, banking and trading centers and a gateway between East and West. You’ll find amazing dim sum, floating islands and a one-of-a-kind skyline. </a></p>

<div class="whole"></div>
<h2 id="cost">Typical cost</h2>
<p><strong>Accomendation</strong>-To make a relatively accurate budget calculation for your South East Asia trip, plan for $50 – $60 per day for a couple, which equals $1,500 – $1,800/month. Plan on $35 – $40 per day for one person travelling, which equals $1,050 – $1,200/month.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation</strong>-affodable</p>
<p><strong>Food</strong>-Your usual daily expenses will be roughly £22 a day on average, with some days being less and some days being more.  This gave me enough money to stay in a cheap hostel, drink (heavily!), eat street food or in a cheap restaurant, get a cab or tuk tuk or 2, & get my laundry done when needed.</p>


<div class="empty"></div>
<h2 id="tips">Travelling Tips</h2>
<ol>
<li>Always have toilet paper – There is never any around, but when you do find some, stock up!</li>
<li>Research cab fares before you arrive – One of the biggest scams in southeast Asia is with cabs ripping people off. Know how much it should cost to get from where you are arriving to your accommodation. You can usually figure out what cabs should cost by asking others you meet on the road. Or find out what cab companies are trusted. Email a hostel and ask.</li>
<li>Know if there will be an ATM – You won’t have a problem with finding ATMs in most of SE Asia, but there will be the odd spot where there are none. Plan ahead! Some examples are El Nido, Philippines and Koh Rong, Cambodia.</li>
<li>Wifi is everywhere, no need to buy SIM cards – Free wifi is honestly way easier to come by than expected and for the most part it is decent. That being said, SIM cards are super cheap so you’re not breaking the bank buying them. But why spend the money when you could easily save? And if you’re worried about getting lost, download Maps.me, an app that doesn’t need wifi to use maps!</li>
<li>Always have USD – If you ever run out of the local currency USD will be accepted. Most boarders require you to pay in USD as well. I recommend getting some in your home country and bringing it with you, though some countries (like Cambodia) dispense USD as well as the local currency.</li>
<li>Research scams to lookout for before you go to a new country/cross borders – A lot of scams in SE Asia are common, so make sure you know what to look out for. Most have to do with cabs, renting scooters, and crossing borders.</li>
</ol>

<div class="empty"></div>
<h2 id="info">Important Information</h2>
<ol>
<li>Plan around the weather – Check the weather for each of your destinations and plan around the heat. Avoid monsoon season and aim for the low season to get the best deals.</li>
<li>ABudget – Asia can be as expensive or as cheap as you wish. It is possible to spend as little as £20 a day but I recommend at least £50 a day (per couple) is a good amount to budget. A typical day in Vietnam for us would cost: Private double room with ensuite: £11, breakfast (pancakes and juice from nearby restaurant): £4, taxi ride: 60p, attractions (museum entrance and park): 52p per person, lunch (overeating) at a local market: £4, attractions (Pagoda searching and general wandering around taking street photos): free, dinner (three course, sit down restaurant including two alcoholic drinks each): £15, beer at local bar: £1.20 and cocktails at local bar  £1.60 = One day cost £37.92.</li>
<li>Respect local beliefs – Whether its not touching peoples head, walking on the other side of the road from a monk or removing your shoes, read the signs and follow the rules. You’re a guest in the country so be as respectful as you would be if you were a guest at your in-laws home (my rule of thumb).</li>
<li>Local water – Don’t drink water from the taps, it isn’t clean and will make you sick.</li>
<li>xpect to get ripped off – Unfortunately, it will definitely happen at some point in your trip. You will get into a taxi who refuses to use the meter, have a tuk-tuk try and take you to his mates suit store or be massively overcharged for something weird looking on a stick. Haggle when you can, get out of taxis and make the most of your trip. On our first visit to Bangkok, we got frustrated with the taxis but after walking out of one or two, we always found someone around the corner who would use the meter.</li>
