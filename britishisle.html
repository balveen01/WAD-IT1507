<p class="information"><img src="britisimage/british.jpg" alt="picure" class="huge" width="2120" height="894"/><br>
The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland, the Isle of Man and over six thousand smaller isles.[7] Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km2,[5] and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: the Republic of Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island of Ireland)[8] and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The islands of Alderney, Jersey, Guernsey and Sark are sometimes also taken to be part of the British Isles[9] even though, as

<h2 id="cost">Typical cost</h2>
<p><strong>Accomendation</strong>-Hostels cost between 15-40 GBP a night for a dorm room; more in the big cities, less in the countryside. Amenities usually include free internet, breakfast, a common room, TV, and laundry facilities. Private rooms in hostels (twin or double) start at around 50 GBP and go up from there. Budget hotels offer the same amenities and start around 60 GBP per night for a twin room. </p>
<p><strong>Transportation</strong>- In the United Kingdom, the National Rail service is always expensive. It’s one thing citizens in this part of the world love to complain about. A journey from London to Liverpool can cost as little as 25 GBP or as much as 150 GBP during peak hours (mid-day)! By booking your ticket with the National Rail over a week in advance and during off-peak hours, you’ll be able to find the cheaper tickets.</p>
<p><strong>Food</strong>-You can eat cheap in England if you really pay attention. Fish and chips or a kebab are only a couple of pounds. Indian and Asian food can be purchased for 6 GBP for lunch entrees. </p>

<h2 id="tips">Travelling Tips</h2>
<ol>
<li>Seasonally Appropriate Clothes – In the UK there is no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing. It gets cold in the winter, but it’s not all that warm in the summer either. Pack layers that can be mixed and matched, including a light jacket and Pashmina scarf or throw. Jeans are stylish, and warm in the winter, but are prone to getting soaked in the rain and damp. Having a pair of leggings or quick drying pants to bring along can be helpful for staying warm and dry when the weather turns. </li>
<li>UK Power Adapters – UK outlets and American electronics will not work together unless you use an adapter. The UK and Ireland use a higher voltage than the United States, and can easily destroy your electronics if you plug them in without an adapter. The electrical outlets are also in a different configuration than in the States, so you probably won’t be able to plug anything in without the adapter. In parts of the UK you may need to flip a switch on the wall to get the power outlets to actually work. </li>
<li>Rain Gear – A lightweight rain jacket you can easily put on over your layers, and then pack away into itself after the rain, is probably a better bet than carrying an umbrella. </li>
<li>Fold-up Shopping Tote and/or Small Day Pack – Most shops in the UK will charge 5p or more for a plastic shopping bag. It’s best to carry a lightweight shopping tote that rolls up into a pocket-sized pouch to carry your purchases. Using a small, lightweight backpack is great for carrying your sweater, camera, water bottle, etc. while you leave your large bag/luggage at the hotel or on the tour bus. </li>
<li>Refillable Water Bottle – Either bring along your own or save a plastic one to keep hydrated on the plane and walking around. The water in Scotland is especially delicious. If you bring one from home, make sure it’s empty before going through airport security, and fill it at a drinking fountain once you’ve been through.</li>
<li>Swimsuit – If you are traveling during high summer (July and August) you may want a suit for hitting the beaches. From October to March it will be much too cold to swim. Swimsuits are also useful for visiting any spas you may encounter.</li>
